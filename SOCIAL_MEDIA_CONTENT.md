### Week 1: Education & Facts

**Day 1**
"Dolphins have names for each other. Each dolphin develops a unique signature whistle - essentially their name - within their first year of life. When separated, they call out each other's names to reunite. 🐬

**Day 2**
"BREAKING: AI analysis reveals dolphins may have grammatical structure in their communication - similar to human language syntax.

Our DolphinGemma project is making this discovery possible.

#AIResearch #Cetaceans"

**Day 3**
"A dolphin's brain is 20% LARGER than a human brain relative to body size.

They have:
- Self-awareness
- Complex problem-solving
- Cultural transmission of knowledge
- Individual personalities

Yet 300,000 die in fishing nets annually. We must do better.

**Day 4**
"What if we could actually talk to dolphins?

Not training them to understand us - but learning THEIR language.

That's the goal of the Dolphin Singularity.

Explore the science: [link]

#DolphinSingularity #AnimalCommunication"

**Day 5**
"Dolphins use echolocation so precise they can:
- Detect a BB pellet from 50 feet away
- Distinguish between different metals
- Create 3D mental images of objects

It's biosonar that exceeds our best military technology.

#DolphinFacts #MarineScience"

**Day 6**
"Thread: How AI is decoding dolphin communication 🧵

1/ Dolphins produce 3 main sound types: whistles (communication), clicks (echolocation), and burst-pulses (emotional states)

2/ Each dolphin's signature whistle is unique - like a name. AI can now identify individual dolphins with 94% accuracy..."

**Day 7**
"Question for our community:

If we achieve bidirectional communication with dolphins, what should be the FIRST thing we ask them?

Our vote: \"What can we do to help you?\"

What's yours? 👇"

### Week 2: Research Updates

**Day 8**
"RESEARCH UPDATE:

DolphinGemma has analyzed 10,000+ hours of dolphin vocalizations from 15 populations worldwide.

Early findings suggest regional \"dialects\" - dolphins from different areas have distinct communication patterns.

Full update: [link]

#DolphinResearch"

**Day 9**
"Why dolphin communication matters for AI:

Dolphins evolved sophisticated communication in a completely different environment (underwater) with different constraints than humans.

Understanding their system could revolutionize how we think about intelligence itself.

[link]"

**Day 10**
"Dolphins can:
✅ Recognize themselves in mirrors
✅ Understand pointing gestures
✅ Learn artificial languages with grammar
✅ Pass knowledge across generations
✅ Solve complex puzzles cooperatively

This isn't just instinct. This is intelligence.

#CetaceanIntelligence"

**Day 11**
"New blog post: \"The Ethics of Interspecies Communication\"

Once we can truly communicate with dolphins, do they deserve legal personhood?

What are our obligations to beings we can talk to?

Read & discuss: [link]

#Ethics #AnimalRights"

**Day 12**
"Fun fact: Dolphins can stay awake for 15+ days straight.

How? They sleep with one half of their brain at a time while the other half stays alert.

This \"unihemispheric sleep\" allows them to breathe consciously and watch for predators.

Nature is incredible. 🐬✨"

**Day 13**
"CONSERVATION ALERT:

Ship strikes kill thousands of dolphins annually. But AI-powered acoustic monitoring can detect dolphins and alert ships in real-time.

Technology isn't just helping us understand them - it's helping us protect them.

Take action: [link]"

**Day 14**
"Weekend reading: 📚

**Day 26**
"RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT:

Dr. Vincent Janik's 2013 paper proving dolphins use signature whistles as \"names\" was groundbreaking.

But here's what most people don't know: dolphins don't just use their own whistle. They copy OTHERS' whistles to call them.

That's referential communication - extremely rare in animals.

Paper: [DOI link]"

**Day 27**
"Unpopular opinion:

Swimming with wild dolphins isn't magical - it's harmful.

- Disrupts natural behavior
- Separates mothers from calves
- Causes stress
- Habituates them to boats (dangerous)

Real respect means appreciating them from a distance.

**Day 29**
"Thinking about the Dolphin Singularity...

What happens when another intelligent species can advocate for themselves?

When they can say \"we don't want to be in captivity\"?
When they can describe their ocean from their perspective?
When they can ask US questions?

## Reddit Post Examples

### r/science

**Title:** "Researchers achieve 94% accuracy in identifying individual dolphins from vocalizations using AI, paving way for translation of dolphin communication"

**Post:**
"Greetings r/science,

I'm part of a research team working on AI-powered analysis of dolphin communication. I wanted to share some recent progress and get your thoughts.

**Background:** Dolphins use signature whistles - unique vocalizations that function like names. Previous studies have shown dolphins use these for individual recognition, but analyzing them at scale has been challenging.

**What we did:** We trained a convolutional neural network on 10,000+ hours of dolphin vocalizations from 15 populations worldwide. The network learns to identify acoustic features unique to each individual.

**Results:** 
- 94% accuracy in identifying individuals from signature whistles
- Detected previously unknown pattern variations that correlate with behavioral contexts
- Identified regional \"dialects\" - systematic differences between populations

**Why it matters:** This level of accuracy enables us to track individuals non-invasively and builds toward the ultimate goal: decoding semantic meaning in dolphin communication.

**Paper:** [Link to technical documentation]
**Code:** [GitHub repo]

Happy to answer questions about the methodology, ethics, or implications!

[Verification that you're the researcher]"

### r/MachineLearning

**Title:** "[R] DolphinGemma: Applying Transformer Architecture to Non-Human Communication"

**Post:**
"Hey r/MachineLearning,

Sharing an interesting application of NLP techniques to cetacean bioacoustics.

**Problem:** Dolphin vocalizations are complex, multi-layered signals. Traditional feature extraction loses contextual information.

**Approach:** We adapted a transformer architecture (similar to BERT) but for acoustic sequences rather than text tokens. Key modifications:

- Input: Mel-spectrogram patches (not text)
- Attention mechanism across temporal and frequency dimensions
- Self-supervised learning on unlabeled acoustic data
- Fine-tuning on labeled behavioral contexts

**Dataset:** 10k+ hours, 15 populations, ~200 identified individuals

**Results:**
- Signature whistle identification: 94% accuracy
- Behavioral context prediction: 82% accuracy
- Discovered hierarchical structure in vocalization sequences

**Open questions:**
- How to validate \"meaning\" without ground truth translation?
- Handling domain shift between populations?
- Ethical frameworks for this type of research?

GitHub: [link]
Paper: [link]

Would love feedback from the ML community!"

### r/marinebiology

**Title:** "Working on AI-powered dolphin communication research - what questions should we be asking?"

**Post:**
"Hi marine biologists,

I'm working on a project using machine learning to analyze dolphin vocalizations. We've made good technical progress, but I want to make sure we're asking the right biological questions.

Current focus:
- Signature whistle identification
- Behavioral context of vocalizations
- Regional variation in communication patterns

What I'm curious about from the biology side:
- What would be most useful for conservation efforts?
- What hypotheses about cetacean communication need more data?
- Are there specific populations we should prioritize studying?

I'm not a marine biologist by training (computer science background), so I really value your expertise. What am I missing? What should we be measuring that we're not?

Thanks for any insights! 🐬"
