## 📅 WEEK 1: FOUNDATION (Goal: 100 visitors/day)

### Day 1 - LAUNCH DAY 🚀

**Morning (2 hours):**

**Twitter Launch Thread:**
```
🚨 Today we're launching something unprecedented 🐬🤖

We're using AI to decode dolphin communication—and we're getting close to understanding their language.

Here's what we've discovered (and how YOU can help): 🧵

[1/12]

Dolphins have "signature whistles"—essentially names they use to call to each other. Our AI can now identify individual dolphins with 94% accuracy just from their voice.

That's like recognizing a friend's voice in a crowded room. But for dolphins.

[2/12]

- Recent breakthrough moments
- What this means for conservation
- How people can contribute
- Call to action: Visit site, sign up, share]

[12/12] 

We just launched dolphinsingularity.org with:
• Free educational resources
• Real dolphin vocalizations library
• Research papers & findings
• Ways to help conservation

RT to help us reach marine biologists, AI researchers, and ocean lovers 🌊

Title: We're using AI to decode dolphin communication. Here's our progress [OC]

Body:
After 18 months of training neural networks on dolphin vocalizations, our team has reached a milestone: 94% accuracy in identifying individual dolphins from their signature whistles.

More interesting: We're starting to see patterns that suggest grammatical structure in their communication.

I've written up our findings here: [link to blog post, not homepage]

Happy to answer questions about the project, the AI architecture, or what we've learned about dolphin intelligence. AMA!
```

**r/MachineLearning** (3.1M members):
```
Title: [R] Using transformer models to analyze dolphin vocalizations - 94% classification accuracy

Body:
We fine-tuned a modified Gemma model on 10,000+ hours of dolphin recordings. Some interesting findings:

• Signature whistles encode individual identity with distinct acoustic features
• Context affects vocalization patterns (feeding vs. socializing)
• Temporal patterns suggest sequential structure

Full methodology and results: [link]

Code: [GitHub repo if you make one]

Would love feedback from the ML community on our approach!

**r/marinebiology** (145K members):
```
Title: AI-powered analysis of dolphin vocalizations - seeking feedback from experts

Body:
Marine biologists of Reddit, we need your expertise!

We've been using machine learning to analyze dolphin communication patterns. Our AI can identify individual dolphins with high accuracy, but we want to ensure our interpretations are biologically sound.

Questions for experts:
• What acoustic features should we be prioritizing?
• Are there known confounds we should control for?
• Who should we be collaborating with?

Project site: [link]

Any guidance would be incredibly valuable!

Subject: AI analysis of dolphin communication - would love your feedback

Hi Dr. [Name],

I came across your research on [specific paper] and was impressed by your work on cetacean cognition.

We've been developing an AI system to analyze dolphin vocalizations, and we've reached an interesting milestone: 94% accuracy in identifying individuals from signature whistles. We're starting to see patterns that suggest more complex structure than previously documented.

I'd love to get your expert perspective on our methodology and findings. Would you be willing to take a look at our research summary?

Website: dolphinsingularity.org/research.html
Summary: [attach 2-page PDF summary]

If you have grad students working in this area, I'd also be happy to discuss potential collaborations.

Thank you for your time,

### Day 2 - Momentum Building

**Twitter (3 tweets, 30 min):**

Morning tweet (9am):
```
Did you know dolphins have "names"? 🐬

Each dolphin creates a unique signature whistle early in life and uses it consistently for decades.

When separated, dolphins call each other's names to reunite.

Our AI can now recognize these names with 94% accuracy.

[Thread explaining the science]
```

Afternoon tweet (2pm):
```
What if I told you dolphins might have grammar?

Our AI analysis suggests their vocalizations follow sequential patterns—like sentences, not just random sounds.

We're not saying dolphins speak English, but they might have linguistic structure.

```

Evening tweet (7pm):
```
Behind the scenes: How we train AI to understand dolphin language 🧠

[Infographic showing the process]

1. Collect 10,000+ hours of recordings
2. Label acoustic features
