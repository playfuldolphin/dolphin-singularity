### CetaCode Architecture
Instead of copying Google's approach, let's create something truly innovative:

**CetaCode = Claude + Audio Processing + Novel AI Architecture**

**Key Innovations:**
1. **Temporal Context Windows** - Analyze communication over extended time periods (minutes to hours, not just seconds)
2. **Multi-Pod Network Analysis** - Map communication networks across multiple pods simultaneously
3. **Predictive Communication Model** - Predict what dolphins will "say" next based on context
4. **Human-Dolphin Interface Layer** - Experimental two-way communication protocols
5. **Real-time Streaming Analysis** - Live interpretation during field research

## 🚀 Recommended Path Forward

### Option A: Conservative (Minimal Changes)
Just rename Project 1:
- **DolphinGemma 2.0** → **CetaCode**
- Keep everything else the same
- Update all documentation

### Option B: Complete Rebrand (Bold)
Rename all projects with unique, memorable names:
- Creates strong brand identity
- Each project stands alone
- More marketable
- Better for publications and partnerships

### Option C: Hybrid (Balanced)
- Main platform: **SonarMind**
- Project 1: **CetaCode** (flagship product)
- Keep other project names descriptive but simple
- Focus branding efforts on CetaCode
